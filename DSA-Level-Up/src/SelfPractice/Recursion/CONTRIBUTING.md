What is recursion? When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

Backtracking :- When execution code is written after function call.

Stack Overflow :- Occurs when we have segmentation fault due to infinite recursion.

Base Condition :- Condition written at the top of recursive function in order to stop the infinite call.

Types of recursion :- * Parameterized * Functional

Subsequence :- A contiguous/non-contiguous sequence, which follows the order.

Recursion 4 approaches :-
1) Base Condition - Hypothesis - Induction
    :- Print1toN, PrintNto1, DeleteMiddleElementOfStack, HeightOfBinaryTree, KthSymbolGrammar, ReverseAStack, SortAStack, SortAnArray, TowerOfHanoi
2) Recursive tree -> IP/OP method Base (Choices+Decisions) 
    :- StringSubsequence, UniqueSubsets, PermutationWithSpaces, 
3) Choice Diagram
4) X

Major Uses of Recursion:-
Used in DS such as Array, String, Linked List, Tree, Graph etc.
Recursion Child concepts :- 
1) Dynamic Programming
2) Backtracking
3) Divide and conquer
